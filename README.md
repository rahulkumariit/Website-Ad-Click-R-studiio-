# Website-Ad-Click-R-studio
A logistic regression approach to predict whether a particular user is going to click on an ad or not ? and to make business decisions on the basis of data analysis and model trained.


Marketing a product through internet is now becoming more popular as compared to traditional marketing strategies from recent years and now most of the companies like to advertise their products on websites and social media platforms. However, targeting the right audience is a very big problem with online marketing. Just spending millions of rupees to display the advertisement to the audience who is not likely to buy the product associated with the advertisement can be very costly. For this it is very important to know whether a particular audience is going to click on the advertisement or not and for that this project focuses on the deployment of logistic regression model in R to predict website AD-click.
